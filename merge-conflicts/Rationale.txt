- Fixed code clashes: Both versions changed the same file in different ways, so you had to fix the parts that didnâ€™t match

- Kept useful parts from both sides: You combined the good changes from both versions into one file

- Made the file work again: After fixing the conflicts, the file now runs without errors and can be used in the project
